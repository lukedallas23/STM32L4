----- DMA -----
- MEM2MEM Mode
- Perph to Perph mode
- DMA Error Checking
    * Function calls should all check if startup has happened and there is no TIP.
- DMA Interrupt Enable

----- SPI -----
- CRC feature enable
- Interrupt Enable is causing an error in the bootloader when programming
- Build option if no DMA being built
- Could put all ISR's into one
- Need new methods for
  1. Slave mode
  2. Unidirectional mode
- FRE Handler
- OVR Handler
- MODF Handler
- CRCERR Handler
- Right now DMA and Poll modes disable interrupts, but it should only disable
  the interrupt for RXNE.
- Need SPI ISR to be the same for each module.
- Need to set RXNE buffer full bit at the start of a transfer.
- CRC for 8/8 Mode need buffer flag set to 8 or can it stay at 16?

----- RCC -----
- Error Checking
- RCC is very feature rich, need to go though and create function to change
  those features. Only have CLK enable/disable and RESET module implemented.

----- GPIO ----
- Error Checking
